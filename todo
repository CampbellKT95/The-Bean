Creating simple landing page for a cafe (baked goods & coffee)

MOBILE FIRST APPROACH

<Navbar />
    a. hamburger shifts upon click...why?

    c. Set media query for nav-logo & nav-title for better spacing at larger size

<Landing />
    Main landing picture -- catchphrase

<Menu />
    a. Create template, and then iterate through with data in array for each menu subsection (ie bagels, donuts, coffee, etc)
    b. Pass along relevant, unique information (key [use index], name, description, price) as props

<Reviews />
    Review section at the end with caroussel functionality

Tidying up:
a. add hrefs
b. --
