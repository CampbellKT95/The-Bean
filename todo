**
Create menuData: include a product id, name & price
**

<Order /> 
    use React-Router:
        on button click, take user to a simple menu site where all ordering 
        functionality takes place

    Will probably need to add counter to each menu item? (useReducer perhaps?)

    Create menu data list, with an inner list containing objects with name,
    price & product id

// Finishing Touches //
