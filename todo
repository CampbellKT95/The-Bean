    try uploading to github, but double check that gitignore ignores the env passcode

    Will need to generate an order number for people to pick up their stuff

// Finishing Touches //

General:
Make the black primary color slightly lighter, and change all it in all locations:
Navbar, Reviews

<Landing />
    Add btn onClick for ordering
        btn currently cannot be clicked, something is overtop of it

<Menu />
    Create menu via looping through. Need menu list

<Reviews />
    Make cleaner style?

<About us />
    Clean up css, especially the grid

<Order />
    Make it so if you click the same item multiple times, it adds a numerical value to keep list short?

REFACTOR, especially the CSS.
